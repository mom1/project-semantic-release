## Commit messages

Since project-semantic-release is released with project-semantic-release we need the commit messages
to adhere to the [angular commit guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#commits).
If you are unsure how to describe the change correctly
Just try and ask in your pr, or ask on gitter. If we think it should be something else or there is a
pull-request without tags we will help out in adding or changing them.
